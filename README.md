This folder contains implementations of numerical methods using Python.

Each file demonstrates a different numerical technique, such as:
- Root finding (e.g., Bisection method, Newton-Raphson method)
- Numerical integration and differentiation
- Solving systems of linear equations
- Interpolation
- Solving ordinary differential equations (ODEs)

All codes are written in Python and can be executed directly.
